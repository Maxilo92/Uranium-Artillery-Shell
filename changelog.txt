Version: 0.1.9
Date: 2025-12-18
  Changes:
    - Increased radiation cloud radius.
    - Increased radiation cloud damage.
    - Changed radiation damage type to 'acid' to ensure it affects structures (nests).
    - Increased technology cost to 750 science packs and 30 seconds.
    - Mutated nests now use green spitter nest graphics and glow green to be visually distinct.
    - Mutated entities now decay based on percentage of max health (3% per second).
    - Improved proximity contagion: Removed inactive spread_fire_entity and implemented independent on_tick contagion system.
    - Contagion carriers now include sticker-bearers and editor-placed mutated entities.
    - Contagion runs every 0.33–1.0 seconds depending on performance safeguards.
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed nests not mutating.
    - Fixed mutated units losing their attack group/command when mutating.
    - Optimized performance by filtering damage events and reducing sticker checks.
    - Fixed proximity contagion not working (now uses independent on_tick event instead of on_entity_damaged).
    - Fixed normal aliens throwing particles (removed spread_fire_entity from sticker).
    - Fixed crash "Can't create sticker, target does not accept stickers" by only applying stickers to units/characters and mutating nests/worms directly.
    - Added debug mode `/uranium-debug` to visualize auras, show carrier counts, and log infections.
  Features:
    - Added console commands:
      - /uranium-give: Gives shells and antidotes.
      - /uranium-clear: Removes all radiation from the surface.
      - /uranium-mutate: Mutates the selected entity.
    - Added remote interface for other mods.
    - Added startup setting 'Mutation Decay Rate' to configure how fast mutated units die (default 3%/s).
    - Added proximity contagion: Irradiated entities now spread radiation to nearby entities.
    - Added mutation delay: Entities must be irradiated for a configurable time before mutating (default 1s).
    - Added visual mutation effect (green smoke when mutation occurs).
    - Added settings:
      - Proximity Contagion toggle
      - Mutation Delay (0-60 seconds)
  Changes:
    - Changed RadAway recipe to use Plastic Bar instead of Water Barrel for better automation.
    - Increased radiation cloud radius to 45 (Atomic Bomb size).
    - Scaled up explosion animation to match the larger radius.
    - Increased proximity contagion speed: 50% chance every 0.5s, radius 8 (was 10% every 1s, radius 4).
  Performance:
    - Optimized proximity contagion: Reduced frequency back to 1s (was 0.5s), radius 5, max 10 entities/check.
    - Removed character type from proximity contagion (only affects units/spawners now).
    - Added periodic timer cleanup to prevent memory bloat in long sessions.
    - Reduced player damage check frequency back to 1s for better UPS.
    - Refactored contagion processing: Batch processes tracked carriers (50 per tick) using a rotating cursor.
    - Removed wide surface scans for stickers/mutated entities; carriers are tracked when stickers are applied or entities mutate.
    - Disabled aura cloud creation outside debug mode to reduce entity churn; debug still shows visible aura and rings.
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed mutated nests and worms spawning naturally during map generation.
    - Fixed crash when loading saves from older versions.
    - Fixed mutated spawners not glowing (now use working_visualisations).
    - Fixed memory leaks from mutation timers not being cleaned up.
    - Fixed potential crashes from accessing global table in certain events.

  Features:
    - Mutated units (Biters, Spitters, Worms) are now "unstable":
    - They suffer constant decay damage (negative healing).
    - They are significantly more aggressive (faster movement, attack speed, and vision).
    - They deal 50% more damage.
    - They have normal health (glass cannons).
