Version: 0.1.10
Date: 2025-12-20
  Major Features:
    - Added MK2 Uranium Artillery Shell - extreme-yield endgame weapon equivalent to 3 atomic bombs.
    - Added crafting components: Stabilized Radiation Core and Dense Uranium Casing.
    - Added separate research tree for MK2 shell requiring space science packs.
    - Added radiation decay system - fallout damage decreases from 100% to 20% over 30 seconds.
  Features:
    - Added French and Spanish localizations.
    - Custom graphics for all new items (MK1/MK2 shells, projectiles, components).
    - Green muzzle flash and map visualization for uranium artillery.
    - MK2 explosion uses scaled atomic bomb animation with shockwave effect.
    - Player radiation glow effect when standing in fallout.
    - Enhanced sound effects for MK2 explosion (3x louder, wider audible range).
    - Added debug overlay system: /uranium-debug command shows active radiation cloud zones with countdown timers.
  Changes:
    - MK2 shell creates 60-second fallout duration (vs 30s for MK1).
    - MK2 explosion has 3x damage, 3x radius, and massive visual effects.
    - Improved item descriptions for all uranium shells and components.
    - Added German translations for all MK2 items and descriptions.
    - MK2 artillery shells now properly mutate spawners when radiation cloud reaches them.
    - Removed all blue explosion smoke - only green crater glow and radiation effects remain.
    - Enhanced spawner mutation logic to handle both MK1 and MK2 radiation contact effects.
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed dual mutation race condition causing infinite alien duplication.
    - Fixed player damage not respecting mod settings.
    - Fixed spawner sticker duplication after mutations.
    - Fixed cloud action frequency optimization (30→60 ticks = 50% fewer entity creations).
    - Fixed entity validity checks after mutations.
    - Fixed atomic-explosion prototype fallback for compatibility.
    - Fixed MK2 spawner mutation not triggering from uranium-radiation-contact-mk2 effect.
    - Fixed blue vanilla explosion smoke lingering after atomic-bomb-based explosion.
    - Fixed critical crash when on_entity_damaged event fires before global initialization.

    - Added debug overlays controlled via /uranium-debug command (circle + timer, no settings toggle).
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed nests not mutating and ensured spawner mutation works even when resistant to damage.
    - Prevented mutated spawners from world generation (autoplace removed).
    - Fixed crashes from applying stickers to entities that cannot accept them.
    - Fixed nil global accesses in debug command and handlers.
    - Fixed LuaRendering API errors by avoiding set_text/destroy and using TTL-based overlays.
