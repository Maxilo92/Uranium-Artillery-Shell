[Factorio Mod Portal](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/Uranium-Artillery-Shell)

**Uranium Artillery Shell** is a Factorio mod that adds a powerful new ammunition type for your artillery turrets and wagons, bringing nuclear devastation to long-range warfare.

## Features

### ☢️ Uranium Artillery Shell
*   **Massive Damage**: Deals 1200 combined damage (Physical + Explosion) in a 6.0 tile radius.
*   **Nuclear Fallout**: Creates a lingering, invisible radiation field marked by a **glowing green crater**.
*   **Permanent Radiation**: Enemies (and players!) caught in the blast are afflicted with **Radiation Sickness**.
    *   Lasts indefinitely until death or cured.
    *   Deals **35 damage/second** (deadly even to power armor).
    *   Slows movement speed by 20%.
    *   Infected units leave behind **glowing green trails**.
*   **Anti-Behemoth**: Irradiated units take an additional **5% of their max HP** as damage every second, ensuring nothing survives for long.

### 💊 RadAway (Antidote)
*   **Cure Yourself**: A new consumable item that instantly cures Radiation Sickness.
*   **Cheap to Produce**: Crafted from Coal and Water.

### 🧬 Mutation Mechanic
*   **Radioactive Evolution**: If a biter/spitter nest is hit by radiation, it **mutates**.
*   **Mutated Spawners**: Green-tinted nests that spawn stronger units (Big/Behemoth) much earlier than normal evolution would allow.
*   **Strategy**: Use with caution! While deadly to units, irradiating nests can make the local fauna much more dangerous.

*   **Enable Alien Mutation**: Toggle whether radioactive nests mutate into stronger variants.
